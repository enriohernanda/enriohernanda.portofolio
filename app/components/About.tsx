          <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Enrio Hernanda â€” a passionate Frontend Developer and fresh graduate in Computer Science from Universitas YARSI. I have a strong enthusiasm for crafting modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.</p>
          <p>
            My journey in web development started during my university years, where I explored the foundations of the web â€” HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, I grew more interested in bringing interfaces to life, which led me to dive
            deeper into React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. Through academic projects and personal explorations, Iâ€™ve built hands-on experience turning design ideas into fully functional applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            What excites me the most is the process of creating digital products that feel smooth, efficient, and delightful to use. I value clean code, responsiveness, and accessibility, making sure every user has a seamless experience no
            matter the device.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond coding, I see myself as a continuous learner. I love staying updated with emerging technologies, experimenting with new tools, and challenging myself with projects that push my boundaries. To me, web development isnâ€™t
            just about code â€” itâ€™s about problem-solving, creativity, and building something meaningful.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, some quick bits about me.</p>
